# Selenium W10 Demo
My first Selenium Junit demo

* Read the official documentation for [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
* Download the [gecko webdriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for Firefox and your operating system here:
..* or check out site for [downloading the chrome webdriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

NOTE 1: If you use chrome, the POM file of the demo should also be updated with the chrome equivalent from the [maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-chrome-driver)

NOTE 2: Using chrome requires a [few more steps](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/getting_started/installing_browser_drivers/).

* Clone this repository or download and extract zip file of Selenium demo project to your own directory
* ensure the directory location to the gecko file is corrected in the Junit test case
* Run Junit testcases.
