Read the official documentation for [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
Download the [gecko webdriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for Firefox and your operating system or check out site for [downloading the chrome webdriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

NOTE 1: If you use chrome, the POM file of the demo should also be updated with the chrome equivalent from the [maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-chrome-driver)

NOTE 2: Using chrome requires a [few more steps](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/getting_started/installing_browser_drivers/).

Clone this repository or download and extract zip file of Selenium demo project to your own directory
Ensure the directory location to the gecko file is corrected in the Junit test case.
